          There's a saying: "Quality over quantity", but by that same token
          there's another saying: "Perfection is the enemy of progress".

          In this article, I explore finding the balance between quality and
          quantity.  I discuss some of my own struggles with this issue and the
          practices I use with every project to overcome them.

        <p>
          The main issue with prioritizing quality over quantity is the
          perfectionism trap.  This trap is triggered when the effort put into
          a project proceeds into optimizations that have little to no effect on
          the project's outcome.

          Consider a house.  This is a normal house.  It's made of wood and
          steel and concrete and glass.  Despite being subject to a myriad of
          weather conditions, this house is <strong>not</strong> water tight.
          Nor does it need to be.  Were the house to be completely submerged
          such that being completely water tight is necessary, there are likely
          much larger problems to worry about and its inhabitants have
          (hopefully) evacuated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, were the house watertight, it other issues may arise.  For
          example, if you house is in the North Easter United States, it might
          not vent Radon efficiently.  In the event of a flood, a completely
          watertight house may act as a boat, leading it to be displaced and
          cause unforeseen damage to surrounding structures.
